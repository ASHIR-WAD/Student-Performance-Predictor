**Sprint:** Sprint 2



### ✅ What I Did 
- Created proper SQLAlchemy relationship definitions
- Added datatype clarity to faculty dashboard model display

- Resolved some prediction pipeline errors in `/predict`


### 🎯 What I Plan To Do Today
- Fix table hover UI on React dashboard

- Start planning PDF export for predictions


### ⚠️ Blockers / Challenges
- Response formatting still inconsistent
